This repository's primary use is to showcase my games created using the python pygame module.

Contents:

A* search algorithm visualizer:
	- Program allows user to create a custom graph by drawing on a grid, then visualizes the A* pathfinding process step-by-step.
	- Offers functionality to load and save JSON files created by the program, so graphs can be revisited.
	- Supports multiple goal and start nodes.

Circles:
	- Program creates a grid of circles where the top row and leftmost column act as a legend. The other cells of the grid trace the pattern created by following the legend. 
	- Also possible for each circle to follow the user's mouse instead. 
	- Program was based on a GIF that I have seen somewhere on the web.

Pixel Puzzle Solver:
	- Program allows the user to create and solve pixel puzzles. The game is also known as a Nonogram, or PicaPix, where the user is presented with a blank grid, and must use hints on the vertical and horizontal axis to logically fill in the grid revealing a hidden picture. 
	- Traditionally done in black in white, my program supports multiple color drawings.
